    "header": "Philosophy",
    "paragraph": "There is a balance between the data we need and the way we interact with it. This balance is often at odds with our ergonomics, the limitations of our current communication structures, and the ever increasing speed at which information needs to be updated worldwide. The best solutions are often the ones that go quietly unnoticed. I strive to bring those quiet successes to my work: That rare sound technology makes when a user interacts with it seamlessly the release of a truly great product. Some days are louder than others."
